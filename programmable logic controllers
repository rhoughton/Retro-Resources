By Ron Hicks 

So this article by Ron Hicks is titled programmable logic controllers industrial control is no longer a relay race  

OK so I'll begin by reading this little editor's note that he typically puts at the beginning of each article here he says in many ways this feels like bits from your past so that phrase is in quotation marks because I guess it's like a reoccurring section in the magazine he rates just a few months ago I watched a pressman cussing the relay panel on his press actually I didn't know it was a relay panel until I looked inside that box contained A hellish mess of color-coded wires long ago coated a uniform black and relays ********* and sparking as they connected and disconnected 220 volts AC the hearts of these ancient machines aren't the motors or the fancy rollers they're the relays the cussed nasty grimy indispensable relays read on For more information on new hearts

all right that was one of his better introductions to an article well Ron Hicks begins by saying you may think this article seems out of place in a micro computer magazine but it's not you see programmable controllers are nothing more than micro computers interfaced to real world inputs and outputs in its simplest form a programmable controller consists of a central processing unit attached to inputs and outputs the CPU has a program that tells it to energize or de energize outputs according to the state of its inputs 

industry uses programmable logic controllers known as LCS for a variety of tasks you'll find small PLCS built into electronic motor controllers machine control panels and even vehicles they oversee current draw speed and load factors they monitor limit switches and operator inputs the typical small PLC will have from 16 to 200 IO points larger pocs can control whole assembly lines or entire factories industrial robots and their support equipment such as conveyors tool holders power units et cetera are all major users of OCS not only do they control equipment but they also report system faults to the central computer so technicians can be dispatched many of these units also log data and generate production or maintenance reports these larger PLCS typically have 200 to 2400 IO points I almost said port Sayre well of course locs can be networked via mainframes this way any machine or human on the network shares the IO and data of all the units and software developed on the mainframe can download to one or more controllers one of the early marvels of electrical engineering was the relay using a relay and engineer could control electrical processes using logic relay logic is nothing more than a hardwired program you can control the relay that starts the drill motor by another relay that monitors table position if the table isn't in position the motor won't start this approach worked fine until machines started becoming more sophisticated imagine using relays to also sense drill speed part positioning tool positioning coolant pump operation motor overload and spindle position soon the relay panel necessary to operate a machine becomes more complicated than the machine where I work we have panels containing over 500 relays each of spent many hours trying to find bad relays by substituting good ones for the suspects it isn't much fun 

As computer equipment became cheaper electrical engineers started replacing relay logic with CPU logic many of the early PLC's were based on discrete mini computers modcomp was one of the premier names during the first generation of industrial computers I have one of their early machines complete with 32K of magnetic core memory in its heyday this unit sold for $24,000 as microprocessors came on the scene most manufacturers moved on to the 8080 and later the Z80 and many PLC's still use these chips the other main chip family used is the Intel 8088 and 80188 

these machines fall into second the second generation 

A problem arose when PLC's replaced relay panels plant maintenance personnel and electricians were the main installers and operators of the new technology it was easy enough to follow the installation drawings since they continued to be standard electrical ladder diagrams programming was another thing many of the early machines were programmed in boolean algebraic equations hardly the Forte of the average maintenance mechanic the obvious answer was to use the already familiar latter diagrams latter diagram programming also known as LDP uses graphic images of contacts and coils representing the familiar relay circuits with a ladder diagram an individual line of code is called a rung 

the contacts can be assigned to real inputs so an energized input and a non energized input will cause coil to energize coil can be assigned to a real output as a motor starter or other electrical signal and then LDP program power always flows from left to right although these are examples very simple LDP programs can have up to 100 elements in each programming screen and programs may have U to 100 screens each POC's manufacturer has its own proprietary LDP some implementations have added features such as subroutines and advanced mathematical features the best of the LDP languages support a basic like language composed of key words that can be used in the same networks as the relay contacts I've shown an example of an advanced ladder diagram below 

and he did mention many LDPE's were proprietary he goes on to write many different machines are used as programming and control computers CPM based capro machines were very popular for a while as were vax computers however with the popularity of the IBM PC most companies have switched to the PC standard for their programming and control computers many companies make hardened IBM PC/AT compatibles for industrial users 

they have sealed cases shock mounted hard disks and super heavy duty power supplies in dirtier wet environments they use membrane keyboards at a recent trade show one vendor had his att compatible running in an aquarium with fish swimming around the egg a monitor so I'll skip over the next few sections where he gets really into the details the next section is called system setup then PLC hardware digital inputs output cards analog inputs and then of course analog outputs I will however read from this section titled servo controller cards a servo motor controller is one major PLC use servo motors are used for robots part positioning machine control and a plethora of other uses serval control consists of two separate functions sensing motor position and changing motor position servo controller cards have an output driver and an input the encoder reads a motor spindle position the LDP program decides where the motor should be the CPU sends a signal to the output section of the controller which sends the output to the servo motor the encoder then verifies the motor's new position if the motors shaft hasn't reached the correct position the controller card detects the error and sends a correction via the output to the motor this way the CPU doesn't need a check for proper position so that's pretty much the end of the article he does have a conclusion and then one last section called computer jobs and industry but I'll skip those thanks for watching
